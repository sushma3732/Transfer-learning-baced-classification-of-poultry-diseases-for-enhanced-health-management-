# 🐔Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

A Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution for real-time monitoring of industrial chicken coops using AI/ML and image analysis. The system processes images captured from multiple cameras to detect early symptoms of poultry illness, helping poultry farms take preventive action quickly and efficiently.

## 💡 Overview

- **Purpose**: To monitor poultry health using machine learning and image analysis.
- **Target**: Early detection of illness in chickens to reduce mortality and improve overall farm health.
- **Input**: Images captured from camera feeds at regular intervals.
- **Output**: Health alerts and reports based on detected symptoms.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖼️ **Image-based health monitoring**
- 🧠 **AI/ML-powered illness detection model**
- 🐔 **Behavioral and posture analysis**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming**: Python
- **ML/AI**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV

## 🤖 Model Details

The illness detection model performs:
- Preprocessing of poultry images (e.g., resizing, noise removal)
- Feature extraction (e.g., abnormal posture, drooping wings, isolation)
- Classification using trained ML models

## 📸 System Workflow

1. Images captured from cameras at regular time intervals.
2. Images processed through the analysis pipeline.
3. AI model identifies symptoms indicative of illness.
